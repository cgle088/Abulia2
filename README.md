# Chooser
An Android app designed to make arbitrary decisions easier. Made with Java using MVP architecture.

The app works by providing an empty list of at least two choices where the user fills in the options. The app randomly chooses one of N options where N <= 10. 

Lists of common choices can be saved, so for example if a user is often torn between eating at Taco Bell, Taco John's, Taco Tuesday's, or Taco Cat they can save these as a list "Taco Restaurants" for quick access later.
